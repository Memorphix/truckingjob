# Trucking Job
**NB!** This script is not planned to be finished. It is just something I made to get more familiar with C# and FiveM. There are bugs, and the script is far away from finished - hence there is a lot of functionality missing. As of initial release, you can only start a mission which wraps you into a truck with an empty trailer. You can go to the dock and load your trailer with a container. Nothing more is possible as of initial commit.

## Commands
/trucker start  - Start a new mission  
/trucker cancel  - Cancel current mission  
/trucker load  - Load container onto trailer  
/trucker salary  - Check your current salary
